/* Universal selector applies to every single thing on a page. We start with */
/* margin and padding at 0 because all browsers automatically add them. */

/* We also set box sizing to border box because it changes the box */
/* model so that the borders and the paddings are no long added to the total */
/* width and the total height that we specify for a box. */

/* We always specify font family inside the body tag because we want font */
/* families to be inhereted and since the body is where we place all of our */
/* other tags inside it makes sense to start with the body tag for thing we */
/* want to have inhereted by all other tags. */

/* We add a padding of 30px which will wrap around the entire website, not */
/* because of inheritance, because padding is not passed down automatically */
/* like font information. This is completely a stylistic option. */

/* We start by setting our header height to 95vh. What this means is that the */
/* header should always be 95% of the viewport height. If we put it at 100 it */
/* would always be at 100% of the viewport height but for our header here we */
/* only want it at 95% */

/* We then set the background image we want for our header and then we set */
/* the background size to cover which always tries to fill the element or */
/* viewport with the image. */

/* We set background position to top in order to ensure that no matter the */
/* size of the viewport the top of the image always stays at the top of it's */
/* container. */

/* Now we want to add a green filter over our background image and to do that */
/* we have to add another background-image. To specify gradients we always */
/* use background-image. We do this by putting a comma before our url linked */
/* image and adding linear-gradient. We then use the two colors we want. We */
/* can also specify "to right" as our first parameter and linear-gradient */
/* will know we want our gradient to go from left to right. We can also add */
/* bottom and this will say we want gradient from top left to bottom right. */

/* To get the header to display the shape we want we use the new css propery */
/* clip-path with the polygon function. This allows us to say what part/shape */
/* of the image we want to keep displayed. The polygon function allows us to */
/* pick coordinates for our shape. It starts at the top left and goes will go */
/* clockwise. */
