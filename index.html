			<!-- So we want to have more than just the one word outdoors in it but we also want to size each -->
			<!-- part differently. This is a perfect reason to use the span tag as it's designed for styling -->
			<!-- specific parts of text. -->

			<!-- We want to now have all of text centered and have it stay there no matter the size of the -->
			<!-- screen as we are doing a responsive site. To do this we need to put our heading-primary -->
			<!-- into a div so we can simply center the entire box. -->
